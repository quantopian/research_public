    "Quantiles are values defined similarly to the median. Two common kinds are quartiles, which divide the data set into fourths, and percentiles, which divide it into hundredths. The median can also be called the second quartile or the 50th percentile. In general, the $y$th percentile is the value such that $y$ percent of the observations are less than it, and the $n$th quartile is the value such that $n$ fourths of the observations are less than it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the median, there is not always a value that divides the data set perfectly, especially for small data sets. To find the position of the $y$th percentile in a list  of observations $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ sorted in increasing order is\n",
    "$$ L_y = (n + 1) \\frac{y}{100} $$\n",
    "where $n$ is the length of our list of observations. If this gives a fractional position, we interpolate between the positions before and after. For instance, if $L_y = 7.85$, the $y$th percentile would be $.85$ of the way along from $X_7$ to $X_8$, which evaluates to $X_7 + .85(X_8 - X_7)$."
