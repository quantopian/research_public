    "# EventVestor: Earnings Releases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll take a look at EventVestor's *Earnings Releases* dataset, available on the [Quantopian Store](https://www.quantopian.com/store). This dataset spans January 01, 2007 through the current day, and documents quarterly earnings releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blaze\n",
    "Before we dig into the data, we want to tell you about how  you generally access Quantopian Store data sets. These datasets are available through an API service known as [Blaze](http://blaze.pydata.org). Blaze provides the Quantopian user with a convenient interface to access very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blaze provides an important function for accessing these datasets. Some of these sets are many millions of records. Bringing that data directly into Quantopian Research directly just is not viable. So Blaze allows us to provide a simple querying interface and shift the burden over to the server side.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to use Blaze to reduce your dataset in size, convert it over to Pandas and then to use Pandas for further computation, manipulation and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpful links:\n",
    "* [Query building for Blaze](http://blaze.pydata.org/en/latest/queries.html)\n",
    "* [Pandas-to-Blaze dictionary](http://blaze.pydata.org/en/latest/rosetta-pandas.html)\n",
    "* [SQL-to-Blaze dictionary](http://blaze.pydata.org/en/latest/rosetta-sql.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've limited the size of your Blaze object, you can convert it to a Pandas DataFrames using:\n",
    "> `from odo import odo`  \n",
    "> `odo(expr, pandas.DataFrame)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Free samples and limits\n",
    "One other key caveat: we limit the number of results returned from any given expression to 10,000 to protect against runaway memory usage. To be clear, you have access to all the data server side. We are limiting the size of the responses back from Blaze.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a *free* version of this dataset as well as a paid one. The free one includes about three years of historical data, though not up to the current day.\n",
    "\n",
    "With preamble in place, let's get started:"
