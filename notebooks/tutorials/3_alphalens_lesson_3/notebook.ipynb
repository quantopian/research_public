    "# Interpreting Alphalens Tear Sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, you learned how to query and process data so that we can analyze it with Alphalens tear sheets. In this lesson, you will experience a few iterations of the alpha discovery phase of the [quant workflow](https://blog.quantopian.com/a-professional-quant-equity-workflow/) by analyzing those tear sheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze how well an alpha factor predicts future price movements with `create_information_tear_sheet()`.\n",
    "2. Try to improve our original alpha factor by combining it with another alpha factor.\n",
    "3. Preview how profitable our alpha factor might be with `create_returns_tear_sheet()`."

    "### Our Starting Alpha Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code expresses an alpha factor based on a company's net income and market cap, then creates an information tear sheet for that alpha factor. We will start analyzing the alpha factor by looking at it's information coefficient (IC). The IC is a number ranging from -1, to 1, which quantifies the predictiveness of an alpha factor. Any number above 0 is considered somewhat predictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first number you should look at is the IC mean, which is an alpha factor's average IC over a given time period. You want your factor's IC Mean to be as high as possible. Generally speaking, a factor is worth investigating if it has an IC mean over 0. If it has an IC mean close to .1 (or higher) over a large trading universe, that factor is probably **exceptionally good**. In fact, you might want to check to make sure there isn't some lookahead bias if your alpha factor's IC mean is over .1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run the cell below to create an information tear sheet for our alpha factor. Notice how the IC Mean figures (the first numbers on the first chart) are all positive. That is a good sign!**"
