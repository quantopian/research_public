    "\n",
    "- **`root_symbol`**: The root symbol of the underlying asset. For example, `CL` corresponds to crude oil.\n",
    "- **`start_date`**: The date the contract becomes available on Quantopian. Note that the price of a contract might be `NaN` near the `start_date`, as it may not be actively traded until it gets closer to its delivery date.\n",
    "- **`end_date`**: The last date the contract can be traded or closed before delivery.\n",
    "- **`notice_date`**: The date in which the exchange can start assigning delivery to accounts holding long positions on the contract.\n",
    "- **`auto_close_date`**: This is two days prior to either `notice_date` or `end_date`, whichever is earlier.  In backtesting, positions in contracts will be automatically closed out on their `auto_close_date`.\n",
    "- **`tick_size`**: The price of a future can only change in increments of its `tick_size`. For example, `CL` changes in increments of \\$0.01.\n",
    "- **`multiplier`**: The number of units per contract. A contract for `CL` corresponds to 1000 barrels of oil."
