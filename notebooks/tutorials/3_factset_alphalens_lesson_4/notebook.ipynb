    "# Advanced Alphalens concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "You've learned the basics of using Alphalens. This lesson explores the following advanced Alphalens concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grouping assets by market cap, then analyzing each cap type individually.\n",
    "2. Writing group neutral strategies.\n",
    "3. Determining an alpha factor's decay rate.\n",
    "4. Dealing with a common Alphalens error named MaxLossExceededError.\n",
    "\n",
    "**All sections of this lesson will use the data produced by the Pipeline created in the following cell. Please run it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: Until this lesson, we passed the output of `run_pipeline()` to `get_clean_factor_and_forward_returns()` without any changes. This was possible because the previous lessons' Pipelines only returned one column. This lesson's Pipeline returns two columns, which means we need to *specify the column* we're passing as factor data. Look for commented code near `get_clean_factor_and_forward_returns()` in the following cell to see how to do this."
