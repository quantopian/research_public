    "# p-Hacking and Multiple Comparisons Bias\n",

    "Multiple comparisons bias is a pervasive problem in statistics, data science, and in general forecasting/predictions. The short explanation is that the more tests you run, the more likely you are to get an outcome that you want/expect. If you ignore the multitude of tests that failed, you are clearly setting yourself up for failure by misinterpreting what's going on in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly common example of this is when looking for relationships in large data sets comprising of many indepedent series or variables. In this case you run a test each time you evaluate whether a relationship exists between a set of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistics Merely Illuminates This Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "Most folks also fall prey to multiple comparisons bias in real life. Any time you make a decision you are effectively taking an action based on an hypothesis. That hypothesis is often tested. You can end up unknowingly making many tests in your daily life.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example might be deciding which medicine is helping cure a cold you have. Many people will take multiple medicines at once to try and get rid of symptoms. You may think that a certain medicine worked, when in reality none did and the cold just happened to start getting better at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point here is that this problem doesn't stem from statistical testing and p-values. Rather, these techniques give us much more information about the problem and when it might be occuring."

    "### p-value Refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on p-values see [this lecture](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/hypothesis-testing). What's important to remember is they're used to test a hypothesis given some data. Here we are testing the hypothesis that a relationship exists between two series given the series values.\n",
    "\n",
    "####IMPORTANT: p-values must be treated as binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common mistake is that p-values are treated as more or less significant. This is bad practice as it allows for what's known as [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) and will result in more false positives than you expect. Effectively, you will be too likely to convince yourself that relationships exist in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To treat p-values as binary, a cutoff must be set in advance. Then the p-value must be compared with the cutoff and treated as significant/not signficant. Here we'll show this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cutoff is our Significance Level\n",
    "\n",
    "We can refer to the cutoff as our significance level because a lower cutoff means that results which pass it are significant at a higher level of confidence. So if you have a cutoff of 0.05, then even on random data 5% of tests will pass based on chance. A cutoff of 0.01 reduces this to 1%, which is a more stringent test. We can therefore have more confidence in our results."

    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Run fewer tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often the best option. Rather than just sweeping around hoping you hit an interesting signal, use your expert knowledge of the system to develop a great hypothesis and test that. This process of exploring the data, coming up with a hypothesis, then gathering more data and testing the hypothesis on the new data is considered the gold standard in statistical and scientific research. It's crucial that the data set on which you develop your hypothesis is not the one on which you test it. Because you found the effect while exploring, the test will likely pass and not really tell you anything. What you want to know is how consistent the effect is. Moving to new data and testing there will not only mean you only run one test, but will be an 'unbiased estimator' of whether your hypothesis is true. We discuss this a lot in other lectures.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say we run $m$ tests. We should expect to see $ma$ false positives based on random chance that pass out cutoff. If we instead use $a/m$ as our cutoff, then we should expect to see $ma/m = a$ tests that pass our cutoff. Therefore we are back to our desired false positive rate of $a$.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, it assumes that all the tests you are running are independent, and doesn't take into account any structure in your data. You may be able to design a more finely tuned correction factor, but this is adding a layer of complexity and therefore a point of failure to your research. In general any time you relax your stringency, you need to be very careful not to make a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the over-zealousness of Bon Ferroni, often running fewer tests is the better option. Or, if you must run many tests, reserve multiple sets of data so your candidate signals can undergo an out-of-sample round of testing. For example, you might have the following flow:\n",

    " * Let's say there are 100,000 possible relationships.\n",

Keep in mind that this also applies to running many different models or different types of experiments and on different data sets. Imagine that you spend a summer researching a new model to forecast corn future prices. You try 50 different models until finally one succeeds. Is this just luck at this point? Certainly you would want to be more careful about validating that model and testing it out-of-sample on new data before believing that it works."

    "## You can never eliminate, only reduce risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general you can never completely eliminate multiple comparisons bias, you can only reduce the risk of false positives using techniques we described above. At the end of the day most ideas tried in research don't work, so you'll end up testing many different hypotheses over time. Just try to be careful and use common sense about whether there is sufficient evidence that a hypothesis is true, or that you just happened to get lucky on this iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Out-of-Sample Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, out-of-sample testing is one of the best ways to reduce your risk. You should always use it, no matter the circumstances. Often one of the ways that false positives make it through your workflow is a lack of an out-of-sample test at the end."
