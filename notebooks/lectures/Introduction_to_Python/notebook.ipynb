Anything in a comment is generally ignored when the code is actually run, making comments useful for including explanations and reasoning as well as removing specific lines of code that you may be unsure about. Comments in Python are created by using the pound symbol (`# Insert Text Here`). Including a `#` in a line of code will comment out anything that follows it."

Make sure you play around with the cells in each notebook to accustom yourself to the syntax featured here and to figure out any limitations. If you want to delve even deeper into the material, the [documentation for Python](https://docs.python.org/2/) is all available online. We are in the process of developing a second part to this Python tutorial, designed to provide you with even more programming knowledge, so keep an eye on the [Quantopian Lectures Page](quantopian.com/lectures) and the [forums](quantopian.com/posts) for any new lectures."
