    "In order to evaluate a population based on sample observations, the sample must be unbiased. Otherwise, it is not representative of the population, and conclusions drawn from it will be invalid. For example, we always take into account the number of samples we have, and expect to have more accurate results if we have more observations. Here we will discuss four other types of sampling bias."

    "# Data-mining bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Data mining refers to testing a set of data for the presense of different patterns, and can lead to bias if used excessively. Because our analyses are always probabilistic, we can always try enough things that one will appear to work. For instance, if we test 100 different variables for correlation with a dataset using a 5% significance level, we expect to find 5 that are significantly correlated with the data just by random chance. Below we test this for random variables and a random dataset. The result will be different each time, so try rerunning the cell!"

    "Above we data-mined by hand. There is also intergeneratinal data mining, which is using previous results about the same dataset you are investigating or a highly related one, which can also lead to bias.\n",

    "The problem here is that there is no reason to believe that the pattern we found will continue; for instance, if we continue to generate random numbers above, they will not continue to be correlated. [Meaningless correlations](http://tylervigen.com/view_correlation?id=866) can arise between datasets by coincidence. This is similar to the problem of overfitting, where a model is contorted to fit historical data perfectly but then fails out of sample. It is important to perform such an out-of-sample test (that is, using data not overlapping with that which was examined when creating the model) in order to check for data-mining bias."

    "\n",
    "Bias resulting from data availability is called sample selection bias. Sometimes it is impossible to avoid, but awareness of the phenomenon can help avoid incorrect conclusions. Survivorship bias occurs when securities dropped from databases are not taken into account. This causes a bias because future analyses then do not take into account, for example, stocks of businesses that went bankrupt. However, businesses whose stock you buy now may very well go bankrupt in the future, so it is important to incorporate the behavior of such stocks into your model."
