    "We can use factor models to analyze the sources of risks and returns in portfolios. Recall that a factor model expresses the returns as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_i = a_i + b_{i1} F_1 + b_{i2} F_2 + \\ldots + b_{iK} F_K + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By modelling the historical returns, we can see how much of them is due to speculation on different factors and how much to asset-specific fluctuations ($\\epsilon_p$). We can also examine what sources of risk the portfolio is exposed to. In risk analysis, we often model active returns (returns relative to a benchmark) and active risk (standard deviation of active returns, also known as tracking error or tracking risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we can find a factor's marginal contribution to active risk squared (FMCAR). For factor $j$, this is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{FMCAR}_j = \\frac{b_j^a \\sum_{i=1}^K b_i^a Cov(F_j, F_i)}{(\\text{Active risk})^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b_i^a$ is the portfolio's active exposure (exposure different from the benchmark's) to factor $i$. This tells us how much risk we incur by being exposed to factor $j$, given all the other factors we're already exposed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental factor models are often used to evaluate portfolios because they correspond directly to investment choices (e.g. whether we invest in small-cap or large-cap stocks, etc.). Below, we construct a model to evaluate a single asset; for more information on the model construction, check out the fundamental factor models notebook."
